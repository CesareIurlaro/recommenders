    <title>Eventbus</title>
    <simpara>Code Recommenders uses an event bus to get rid of all kind of listener interfaces. Although considered to
        be used internally mostly, the bus may be used by other subscribers (such as usage data collectors, indexing
        services etc.) to respond to events such as compilation unit changes, project creations or deletions etc.
    </simpara>
    <simpara>
        To subscribe to the event bus one has to obtain an instance of
        <classname>EventBus</classname>
        using Code Recommenders' injection service (or Guice Injector).
