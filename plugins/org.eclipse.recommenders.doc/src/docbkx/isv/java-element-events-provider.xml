        The
        <classname>JavaElementEventsProvider</classname>
        sends events such as project open/close or compilation unit added/removed/changed/saved events. This list
        is incomplete and is expected to grow quickly for 1.0. Look at the corresponding class to learn which events it
        posts to the event bus.
